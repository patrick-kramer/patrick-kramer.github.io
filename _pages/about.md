I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated with distinction from Leipzig University with a "Diplom" (German degree, equivalent to joint M.Sc./B.Sc.) in Mathematics in 2024 and B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2019.

My research interests include nonparametric theory, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. In particular, I am interested in research questions at the intersection of those areas and questions motivated by problems in causal inference.
